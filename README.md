# VUMC Bioinformatics: Brainstrom & Exploration

To begin exploring embedding approaches and learn meaningful representations of some of the EHR data and many other important data sets. 

There's a whole disjointed set at the moment with multiple different medical entities and potentially even computationally derived concepts like phenotypes. For now I will explore network relationships and representation learning for ICD-9 disease indication codes, and I'll simply mark where you can find these other sources of medical ontologies, drug codes, etc.

The Unified Medical Language System is available here: [UMLS](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/)

There's also Human Phenotype Ontology given here: [HPO](https://hpo.jax.org/app/download/ontology)

The e-merge network is another valuable source: [eMERGE](https://emerge-network.org/phenotyping-cohort-discovery-using-ehr-data/)
