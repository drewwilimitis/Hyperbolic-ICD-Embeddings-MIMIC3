I first start exploring embedding methods for representation learning of ICD-9 codes. There's a fairly disjointed set of other data sources at the moment, so I will restrict my analyis to just this ICD-9 data for now. These other sources of medical ontologies, drug codes, and computationally derived phenotypes are available below.


- The Unified Medical Language System is available here: [UMLS](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/)
- There's also Human Phenotype Ontology given here: [HPO](https://hpo.jax.org/app/download/ontology)
- The e-merge network is another valuable source: [eMERGE](https://emerge-network.org/phenotyping-cohort-discovery-using-ehr-data/)



The following figure attempts to show the non-trivial way in which these can all be synthesized
