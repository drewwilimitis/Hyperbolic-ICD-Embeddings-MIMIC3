# Hyperbolic Embeddings of ICD Diagnostic Codes with Real Hospital Data (MIMIC-3)

I test novel Hyperbolic embedding methods to learn representations of ICD-9 codes using co-occurrences in real hospital data.

I evaluate the performance of these embedding approaches in terms of their ability to group similar diagnoses together.

Finally, I use exploratory data analysis to understand the structure of the MIMIC-3 dataset and prepare the data for predicting mortality.

I briefly test whether features based on these ICD embeddings are useful predictors of in-hospital mortality.
